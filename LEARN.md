# Learn about Password Generation
Welcome to my project! If you're interested in learning about how password generation works, you're in the right place.

## Resources
To get started, here are some resources you can explore:
1. **Password Entropy**: Understanding password entropy is crucial for generating secure passwords. You can learn more about it from these resources:
   - [GeeksforGeeks: Password Entropy in Cryptography](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/password-entropy-in-cryptography/)
   - [Baeldung: Calculation of Password Entropy](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/password-entropy#calculation-of-password-entropy)
2. **Project Documentation**: Explore our project's documentation to understand how we implement password generation and strength assessment.
3. **Related Issues**: Check out the project's [Issues](https://github.com/gegelendvay/Password-Generator/issues) for discussions and feature requests related to password generation.
